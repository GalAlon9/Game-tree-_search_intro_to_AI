To run the program you need to add an input file in the format of the one that already exists in the directory.
When running the program you need to specify the input file as a command line argument.

The program will ask you to chose a game mode. The game modes are:
1. Adversarial
2. Semi-cooperative 
3. fully-cooperative 

You will be asked to chose each agent starting position.

After this a print out of the environment will be shown and the game will start.

Enjoy! :)
